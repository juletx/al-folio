System for the definition and implementation of software development processes based on metamodels.

## Objective

Build a system for the definition and implementation of software development processes based on metamodels. There are several methodologies suitable for software development, and it is important to define the information of these methodologies through models so that they can be managed flexibly.

## Development

The OpenUP methodology was used for the development of the project and the CCII-N2016-02 standard for the drafting of the project documentation.
